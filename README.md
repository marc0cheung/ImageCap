## How To Use ImageCap

- Use `Width` and `Height` input box to adjust the size(resolution, px) of the capture image. 
  P.S. Preview Box DO NOT support Auto-Resize currently, so use resolution other than 416*416 might cause GUI bugs, pending to be solved in the next update version...
- Use `.png` format to capture images by default. 
- Use `index` input box to input the index of the image. 
  e.g. Input "0", the first capture image filename will be `1.png` 
- Click `Save Pref` Button to save the configs above.
- `Test Frame` Button is a useless button in `ImageCap_GUI.py` but use to preview camera capture in `gui_no_real_time.py` . BC the latter code CANNOT implant real-time preview of video stream. The problem fixed in   `ImageCap_GUI.py` . So when `Test Frame` Button is clicked, the message box will pop up as follows.

- Before using `Cap!` to get a photo, user needs to select a saving path by clicking the `Select Path` Button below the Application Window. Otherwise an Error Box would pop up and remind the user that "Please select a saving directory first"
- After selecting the saving path, you can click `Cap!` to take photos. The `Status` part of the application will also remind user of the saving status of the photos.
- If the capture process is unexpectedly interrupted, you can reset the index with `Index` to continue taking and storing photos in the same path.
